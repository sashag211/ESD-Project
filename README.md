# ESD-Project
The group ESD project created for the purpose of the module assignment.

Database information needs to be updated by a year as it is outdated.


Please note:
When updating the project do not push to the master file, create a branch and upload what you need. 


Open zip file jack uploaded,

create database called "MyUse"
username is APP with no password (will create one for the actual database, will update instruction once database is implemented into main file) 
create table called "Users"
columns include "username" "password" caps don't matter
populate table with some details 
run ?? (hopefully should work, if i have missed something and you know how to solve it, add it)



Database Will be called XYZDriver
Username : Root
Password : 1234
